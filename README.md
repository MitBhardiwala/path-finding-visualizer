# Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive web application that visualizes various pathfinding algorithms in action. Watch how different algorithms navigate through a customizable grid to find the shortest path between two points.

## Features

- **Multiple Pathfinding Algorithms:**
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm - Guarantees the shortest path
  - A* Search - Uses heuristics for optimized pathfinding
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS) - Explores nodes level by level
  - Depth-First Search (DFS) - Explores as far as possible along branches

- **Interactive Grid System:**
  - Click and drag to create walls
  - Set start and end points
  - Clear board functionality
  - Adjustable grid size

- **Dynamic Visualization:**
  - Real-time algorithm execution
  - Color-coded states for visited nodes, walls, and path
  - Speed control for visualization
  - Step-by-step execution option

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
